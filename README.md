Maze:
=====

This program is written in Java and finds the shortest way in a given maze. 

First the program analyses a text file "Labyrinthe.txt" containing mazes. 
The mazes (L) consist of quadratic wall elements (w), a starting point (b) and way elements. Way elements can be a finish point (z), dead ends (s) or crossroads (k).
Valid mazes are written in a textfile called "Landkarte.txt" in 2D representation. Moreover the directions one goes of the shortest way found are written in the output file. Invalid mazes display an error message in the output file.
